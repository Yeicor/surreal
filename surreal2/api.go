// Algorithm builds a surface by moving along it's border and making lines as long as possible.
//
//  PARAMETERS:
//  - minAngle limits the angle between tangents to generate a new vertex (maximum value is 90ยบ, expressed in radians).
//  - step is the distance between surface checks and is useful for avoiding skipping small features that return
//    to the original tangent. Keep it as close to 0, as possible (as long as performance is good enough).
//  - normalEps should generally be as close to 0 as possible (considering numerical inaccuracies).
//  - scanSurfaceCells is required when there are multiple surfaces, as the algorithm needs to find each one of them to
//    properly generate them.
//  - scanSurfaceDistSq is the minimum distance between surfaces to consider them as different (keep as high as your
//    surfaces allow in order to avoid double surfaces)
//  - surf* see fallToSurface.
//  - rng is only used for fallToSurface (to solve 0 gradient by pushing in a random direction).
